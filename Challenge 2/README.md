# Challenge 2: Open Challenge

The output of a flight is a dataset containing a high quality photos of a site. We process this output to generate 3D maps where our clients can see and analyze their sites in our DataHub application.

Do you want to see this in action? Come to our DataHub demo.

We already show you what we can do with a dataset, now what can you do with it?. This is an open challenge where you can experiment, create, and innovate using the data that Skycatchs can provide you. 

#### Deliverables

* Implementation extracting useful information from dataset
* Pitch Document
  * Git repository. README is appreciated. 
  * Demo video.  Show us how it works.
  * Document/Slides.
    * Problem definition. 
    * What you guys did.
    * What you plan for the future.

#### Example

* GCPs are Ground Control Points used to get accurate data whenever the drone does not have a way to get its current position. They are essential because they are used later on the application to allow the user to manually move an image and select where the checkpoints are in the ground, enabling our platform to take that information and calculate corrections and create point clouds with minimum margin error.

#### Judging Criteria

* 40% Use of JS/Node related technologies. 
  * Use of the dataset and the elements inside. 
* 25% Business value.  
* 30% 20% Implementation completeness.  
* 15% Creativity.
